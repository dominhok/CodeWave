For: Elderly, Seniors Living Alone, Pregnant Women, Guardians of Infants and Toddlers, and Mobility-Impaired Individuals

1. Wildfire Evacuation Guidelines  
Wildfires spread quickly and unpredictably, making it critical for vulnerable populations to prepare in advance and respond swiftly. The following guide provides tailored evacuation strategies to ensure safety.

Preparation (Before a Wildfire)
- Assign a Care Assistant: Identify a reliable caregiver or neighbor who can assist during emergencies. Record their contact in your emergency contact list and share your location with them regularly.
- Emergency Kit: Prepare a grab-and-go bag containing:
  - Prescription medications and medical devices (e.g., oxygen, inhalers)
  - Bottled water, non-perishable food, and nutrition for infants or the elderly
  - Flashlight, portable radio, power bank, ID cards, and emergency contacts
  - Baby care items (diapers, wipes, formula) and assistive devices (canes, wheelchairs)
- Evacuation Route Planning: Determine the safest and shortest route to a designated shelter (such as a school or community center away from forests). Rehearse it with your caregiver.
- Home Safety Check:
  - Install non-combustible materials within 1.5 meters of your house.
  - Remove dry leaves or wood debris from your yard, roof, and gutters.
  - Install smoke detectors and fire extinguishers; confirm they are functional.
- Family & Community Coordination: Inform family and neighbors of your plan. Join local evacuation drills, especially if you live alone or have limited mobility.
- Pet/Livestock Plan: Prepare crates, leashes, food, and water supplies. If pets must stay behind, ensure access to food and open gates to allow escape.

Response (When a Wildfire Threatens)
- Act Immediately: Evacuate as soon as you receive warnings or smell smoke. Do not wait for mandatory evacuation orders if you feel unsafe.
- Indoor Measures:
  - Close all doors and windows. Shut off gas and electrical systems if time permits.
  - Move flammable items (curtains, cushions) away from windows.
  - Leave indoor lights on for visibility through smoke.
- Personal Safety:
  - Dress in cotton clothing with long sleeves and pants. Use a wet cloth to cover your mouth if smoke is present.
  - For babies, use a carrier (not a stroller). Ensure both adult and infant wear protective shoes.
  - Individuals with reduced mobility should request transport support early—never wait.
- Transport:
  - Ensure your vehicle is fueled and parked facing the road for quick departure.
  - Take only essentials. Avoid congested routes near forest edges.
- Communicate:
  - Inform family or emergency services (dial 119 in Korea) of your departure and destination.
  - Carry a whistle or phone in case you get separated or need help.

If Trapped Outdoors
- Stay low to avoid smoke inhalation.
- Find a clearing away from trees and lie face down, covering yourself with soil or a wet blanket.
- Avoid canyons or uphill slopes where fire may travel faster.

After the Wildfire
- Return home only when authorities declare it safe.
- Watch for hot spots, unstable structures, or gas leaks.
- Monitor physical and emotional well-being. Seek medical attention for burns, smoke inhalation, or trauma.

2.Landslide Evacuation Guidelines  
Landslides often occur with little warning, especially after heavy rain or in mountainous areas. Vulnerable individuals must take early precautions and respond swiftly to avoid injury or entrapment.

- Evacuation Procedure:
  - Move to a designated safe area (school, government building) away from hills and rivers.
  - Assist mobility-impaired individuals and secure infants in a baby carrier.
  - Avoid slopes, ditches, and areas near retaining walls.
- Indoor Safety (if evacuation is not possible):
  - Go to the highest floor and stay near a load-bearing wall opposite the slope.
  - Avoid basements or rooms facing the hillside.
  - Shut off gas and electricity to prevent fire or leaks.
- Communication:
  - Call 119 (Korea) or send a message with your location if unable to move.
  - If trapped, make noise, flash lights, or use a whistle to alert rescuers.

If Trapped or Cut Off
- Stay calm and avoid unstable structures.
- Conserve battery and stay in communication with emergency services.
- Do not attempt to climb unstable debris or exit through windows unless instructed.

After the Landslide
