# CodeWave - Rapid & Personalized Disaster Safety Alert System

## Project Goal

**To deliver timely and personalized safety guidance during disasters via SMS and voice calls, adapting to user location, language, and specific needs.**

CodeWave leverages AI to provide crucial, context-aware instructions and intelligently interprets voice responses to connect users needing help with emergency services automatically.

## Overview

CodeWave is an intelligent communication platform designed for disaster scenarios. It integrates AI and communication technologies to deliver tailored safety alerts. Utilizing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and sophisticated LLMs, the system generates contextually relevant safety information and understands user voice input to identify and assist those in distress.

## Key Features

### 1. Adaptive Personalized Alerting
*   **Contextual User Profiles:** Securely manages user information including precise location (via geocoding), vulnerability considerations (e.g., visual/hearing impairment, mobility issues), language preference, and contact details.
*   **Precision Targeting:** Disseminates alerts exclusively to users within the defined impact radius of a disaster event.
*   **AI-Generated Guidance:**
    *   Employs RAG with curated safety manuals (`how-to-s/`) to generate **actionable core guidance** (SMS/Voice) specific to the disaster type.
    *   Dynamically adapts message content and tone based on user vulnerability profiles, leveraging LLM capabilities.

### 2. Interactive Communication & Emergency Support
*   **Multi-Channel Delivery:** Utilizes Twilio API for robust delivery of alerts via both SMS and voice (TTS).
*   **Intelligent Voice Interaction:** Captures and interprets user voice responses using advanced STT.
*   **AI-Powered Response Assessment (Claude 3.5 Sonnet):** Analyzes voice responses to accurately determine if a user requires urgent assistance or is reporting a critical situation.
*   **Automated Emergency Assistance Forwarding:** When assistance is needed, the system automatically initiates a call to the designated emergency contact number (`EMERGENCY_PHONE_NUMBER`).
    *   Provides the operator with essential details: **user's phone number, reported location,** and the **transcribed voice message**.

### 3. Enhanced Situational Awareness & Accessibility
*   **Real-time Safety Resources:** Integrates with external APIs like the Safety Data Portal (Korea) to provide locations of nearby shelters.
*   **Geospatial Intelligence:** Uses Kakao Geocoding for accurate address-to-coordinate conversion.
*   **Interactive Incident Map:**
    *   Delivers a unique map link via SMS (`/map/disaster_map/{simulation_id}`).
    *   Visually presents the disaster epicenter and radius, user's current location, the nearest available shelter, and directions (Naver Maps API).
*   **Regional Insights Dashboard:** Offers an aggregated summary of user voice reports by region, generated by an LLM (`/api/dashboard/summary`).

## Use Cases & Personalization Examples

CodeWave ensures effective communication across diverse user needs:

*   **Scenario: Large Fire in Gangnam-gu**
    *   **Elderly Resident (Korean, SMS Preferred):** Receives a concise Korean SMS focusing on fire safety relevant to their profile, possibly advising shelter-in-place guidance if evacuation is challenging, plus the map link.
    *   **Visually Impaired User (English, Call Preferred):** Receives a clear English voice call (TTS) detailing the fire, with audible instructions. They can respond verbally; STT hints enhance recognition accuracy.
    *   **Hearing Impaired User (Korean, SMS Preferred):** Receives a detailed Korean SMS with guidance and the map link, enabling visual assessment of shelters and the affected zone.
    *   **Foreign Resident (English, SMS Preferred):** Receives a translated English SMS regarding the nearby incident, advising caution and providing the map link.

*   **System Adaptability:**
    *   **Language:** The system automatically translates core messages based on the user's `preferred_language` setting.
    *   **Modality:** Notification channel (SMS/Voice) is selected based on user preference (`wants_info_call`).
    *   **Content:** User `vulnerability_type` informs the AI to tailor the focus and phrasing of generated advice.

This adaptive approach ensures critical safety information is delivered rapidly and effectively, accommodating language barriers, location specifics, and diverse accessibility requirements.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
*   **AI/LLM:**
    *   Langchain (Orchestration)
    *   Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Voice Interpretation, RAG Summarization)
    *   Upstage (Embeddings, Translation KO->EN)
    *   FAISS (Vector Store)
*   **Communication:** Twilio (SMS, Voice, TTS, STT)
*   **Database:** SQLAlchemy (Default: SQLite)
*   **APIs & Mapping:** Kakao Geocoding, Safety Data Portal (Korea), Naver Maps API
*   **Infra & Tools:** Uvicorn, Pydantic, python-dotenv, httpx, Ngrok (for Development Webhooks)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   `pip`
*   API Keys/Accounts: Twilio, Anthropic, Upstage, Kakao (REST & JS), Safety Data Portal (Korea)
*   Ngrok (Optional, for local webhook testing)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone:** `git clone <repo-url> && cd <repo-dir>`
2.  **Virtual Env:** `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` (or `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
3.  **Install Deps:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  **Environment Variables:**
    *   `cp .env.example .env`
    *   Edit `.env` and **fill in all required API keys and phone numbers**. Ensure `EMERGENCY_PHONE_NUMBER` is correctly set.
    *   Configure your public URL (e.g., Ngrok for development) by setting `BASE_URL` in the `.env` file. This URL is used for generating links in notifications (like the map link).
5.  **RAG Data:** Place relevant safety manuals (`.txt` files) in the `how-to-s/` directory. The vector store is built automatically on the first run.

### Running

1.  **Start Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn flask_twilio_demo.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 30000
    ```
    *   (`--reload` is for development; remove for production).
2.  **Ngrok (if needed for webhooks):**
    *   `ngrok http 30000 --domain <your-reserved-ngrok-domain.ngrok.app>` (Use your reserved domain)
    *   Update Twilio webhook URLs in the Twilio console to point to your ngrok HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://<your-domain>.ngrok.app/twilio/sms`). The application reads the base URL from the `BASE_URL` environment variable for generating callback URLs and map links.
3.  **Access:**
    *   **API Docs:** `http://localhost:30000/docs`
    *   **Map (after simulation):** Link sent via SMS (uses `BASE_URL`).

## Key Endpoints

*   `/api/users/` (POST): Register a new user.
*   `/api/simulate_disaster/` (POST): Trigger a disaster simulation and send alerts.
*   `/map/disaster_map/{simulation_id}` (GET): View the interactive map.
*   `/twilio/sms` & `/twilio/voice`: Webhook endpoints for Twilio.
